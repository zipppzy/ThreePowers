# REQUIREMENTS:
# Requirements are checked before an action starts. They consist of two parts:
#   1. Conditions - Must be satisfied but are NOT consumed (skills, minimum items/reserves)
#   2. Consumables - Items/reserves that ARE consumed when the action starts
#
# Both conditions and consumables use the same tree structure with AND/OR logic.
#
# STRUCTURE:
#   [actions.requirements]
#     [[actions.requirements.conditions]]  # Optional: check-only requirements
#     # ... condition nodes ...
#     
#     [[actions.requirements.consumables]] # Optional: consumed on start
#     # ... consumable nodes ...
#
# NODE TYPES:
#   Logical Operators (have nested nodes):
#     type = "AND"  - All nested nodes must be satisfied
#     type = "OR"   - At least one nested node must be satisfied
#     Use [[node.conditions]] or [[node.consumables]] for nested nodes
#
#   Leaf Nodes (actual checks):
#     type = "skill"
#     name = "SkillName"
#       level = 5                    # Minimum skill level required
#
#     type = "item"
#     name = "ItemName"
#     count = 10                   # Minimum/exact count required
#
#     type = "reserve"
#     name = "ReserveName"
#     value = 50.0                 # Minimum/exact amount required
#
# EXAMPLES:
#
# Simple item cost (consumed on start):
#   [actions.requirements]
#     [[actions.requirements.consumables]]
#     type = "item"
#     name = "Copper Coin"
#     count = 50
#
# Skill requirement (not consumed):
#   [actions.requirements]
#     [[actions.requirements.conditions]]
#     type = "skill"
#     name = "Smithing"
#     level = 5
#
# Both skill requirement AND item cost:
#   [actions.requirements]
#     [[actions.requirements.conditions]]
#     type = "skill"
#     name = "Smithing"
#     level = 5
#     
#     [[actions.requirements.consumables]]
#     type = "item"
#     name = "Iron Ingot"
#     count = 10
#
# Complex: Multiple items with OR logic:
#   [actions.requirements]
#     [[actions.requirements.consumables]]
#     type = "OR"
#       [[actions.requirements.consumables.consumables]]
#       type = "item"
#       name = "Gold Coin"
#       count = 100
#       
#       [[actions.requirements.consumables.consumables]]
#       type = "item"
#       name = "Silver Coin"
#       count = 500
#
# Complex: Skill AND (item OR reserve):
#   [actions.requirements]
#     [[actions.requirements.conditions]]
#     type = "skill"
#     name = "Enchanting"
#     level = 3
#     
#     [[actions.requirements.consumables]]
#     type = "OR"
#       [[actions.requirements.consumables.consumables]]
#       type = "item"
#       name = "Essence Stone"
#       count = 50
#       
#       [[actions.requirements.consumables.consumables]]
#       type = "reserve"
#       name = "Mana"
#       value = 100.0
#
# NOTES:
#   - Skills are NEVER consumed (always use in conditions, not consumables)
#   - For OR with consumables, first available option is consumed
#   - Action button will be greyed out if requirements are not met
#   - Consumables are taken when action STARTS, not when it completes
